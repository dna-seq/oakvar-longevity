The rs1333049 polymorphism may influence successful longevity, possibly by modulating the risk of age-related disorders.	significant	male/female	rs1333049		TP53	GG; GA; GC; AA; CC	0,5; 0; 0; 0; 0		20230275	0.48	17p13.1	Emanuele et al.

387	2014	8	Allele and genotype distributions of rs1333049 were compared in centenarians and younger adults (without (healthy) or with CAD) in two independent cohorts: Spanish and Japanese.	The frequency of the GG genotype in centenarians was higher than either healthy or CAD controls in Spanish. In the Japanese cohort, C allele did not differ between centenarians and healthy controls, but it was significantly lower in centenarians than in CAD controls.	significant	male/female	rs1333049		TP53	GG; GA; GC; AA; CC	0,5; 0; 0; 0; 0		24163049	0.48	17p13.1	Pinós et al.

381	2008	7	Participants (n = 9,219) of the Copenhagen City Heart Study were genotyped for the p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism. Then the morbidity of 6 subtypes of cancer and mortality were assessed for each genotype.	The risk of hematologic cancer increased 2-fold in Arg/Pro heterozygotes vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes (p < 0.001), with a similar trend in Pro/Pro homozygotes. The overall 12-year survival after blood sampling was increased in Arg/Pro heterozygotes with 3% (p = 0.003) and in Pro/Pro homozygotes with 6% (p = 0.002) vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes. The cumulative 5-year mortality after a cancer diagnosis was reduced in Arg/Pro heterozygotes and Pro/Pro homozygotes vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes by 9% (p = 0.003) and 13% (p = 0.03). These results suggest a better prognosis in Arg/Pro heterozygotes and Pro/Pro homozygotes vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes after the diagnosis of cancer or other life-threatening disease.	significant	male/female	rs1042522		TP53	GG; GA; AA	0; 0,5; 1		18256523	0.48	17p13.1	Bojesen and Nordestgaard (2008)	7157

337	2012	23	Using a tagging approach, the possible associations between longevity and the common genetic variation at the three bitter taste receptor gene clusters on chromosomes 5, 7 and 12 in a population of 941 unrelated individuals (20-106 years old) was investigated. The study included 348 very elderly cases (>=85 years, mean age 93.82 years, median age 92) and 593 non-elderly controls (<85 years, mean age 59.17 years, median age 67 years).	One of the analyzed polymorphism, rs978739, situated upstream of the TAS2R16 gene, shows a statistically significant association with longevity. The frequency of A/A homozygotes increases gradually from 35% in subjects aged 20 to 70 up to 55% in centenarians.	significant	male/female	rs978739		TAS2R16	TT; TC; CC	1; 0; 0		23133589	0.24	7q31.32	Campa et al.

338	2013	23	The variability of the three human nitric oxide synthases (NOS1, NOS2, NOS3) was studied in a large sample (763 subjects, age range 19–107 years, median age 81 years). The sample analyzed included 417 females and 346 males.	After adjusting for sex and multiple testing, NOS1 rs1879417 SNP was found to be significantly associated with the longevity phenotype. The additive model for rs1879417 resulted to be the most likely genetic model, in which the presence of the relevant allele (allele C for rs1879417) decreases the probability to attain longevity.	significant	male/female	rs1879417		NOS1	TT; TC; CC	0; -0,5; -1		23572278	0.24	12q24.22	Montesanto et al.

234	2010	20	Analysis was performed in 149 centenarians (mean age 101.1 years old) and in 413 young subjects (mean age 27.1 years old).	The distribution of the Lys751Gln genotypes differed significantly between these groups (P = 0.017). In centenarians, the homozygous genotypes AA and CC were found less frequently than in young controls (29 vs. 36%, OR = 0.71, and 14 vs. 20%, OR = 0.652, respectively). The Arg156Arg and Asp312Asn were not significantly associated with extreme longevity.	significant	male/female	rs13181	Lys751Gln	ERCC2	AA; AC; CC	0; 0,5; 0		19707883	0.17	19q13.32	Polosak et al.

1201	2011	54	Functional SNPs have been determined for 1071 unrelated healthy individuals (502 males and 569 females) from Central Italy, 18-106 years old, divided into three gender-specific age classes defined according to demographic information and accounting for the different survivals between sexes. The categories for men were: individuals <66 years old, individuals 66-88 years old, and individuals > 88 years old. The categories for women were: individuals <73 years old, individuals 73-91 years old, and individuals > 91 years old.	When comparing all 3 age groups, both two-loci and three-loci interaction are significantly associated with life-expectancy in males. For females, a significant two-loci interaction occurs in females between ADA 22G>A (rs73598374) and TNF-a 238G>A (rs361525) only when comparing young and mid-aged individuals.	significant	male	rs73598374		ADA2	AA; AG; GG	1; 0,5; 0		21865054	0.12	20q13.12	Napolioni et al.

493	2009	14	16 known FOXO3A SNPs were examined in 1,762 German centenarians/nonagenarians and younger controls	Polymorphisms in FOXO3A were associated with longevity. The FOXO3A association was considerably stronger in centenarians than in nonagenarians, highlighting the importance of centenarians for genetic longevity research. Replication in 535 French centenarians (mean age: 103.8 years) and 553 younger controls (aged 18–70 years) generated a trend that supported the results, although it was not statistically significant.	significant	male/female	rs519007			AA; AG; GG	0; 0,5; 1		19196970	0.1	6q21	Flachsbart et al.

1316	2013	56	102 SNPs from 16 longevity candidate genes were examined in Danish. 1089 individuals (ages 92.2-93.8, mean age 93.2, 71.3 female) and 736 middle-aged controls (46-55 y, mean age 50.6, 49.6% female) were involved in this case-control study. Then the results were replicated in a German cohort of 1613 individuals (95-110 y, 73.2% female) and 1104 middle-aged controls (mean age 67.2, SD 4.07, 74.3% female). A 11 years study was introduced in Danish cohort to identify the SNPs associated with longevity, then the results were verified in Dutch longitudinal cohort.	The minor allele frequency of rs9923854 in CETP was significantly associated with longevity. Haplotype case–control comparisons identified two haplotypes associated with longevity. Gene-based analysis confirmed the significant association of variations in CETP with longevity. The association of rs9923854 was borderline in the German population.	significant	male/female	rs5883		CETP	CC; CT; TT	0; 0,5; 1		22234866	0.1	16q13	Soerensen et al. (2013)	1071

354	2013	64	630,309 SNPs were examined by genome-wide linkage and association study among 74 successfully aged (35% female, mean age 81.82 years) and 189 'normally aged' (67% female mean age 83.74 years) Amish adults over age 80.	There was evidence for linkage on 6q25-27 near the fragile site FRA6E region with a dominant model maximum multipoint heterogeneity LOD score p= 3.2. The 1-LOD-down support interval for this linkage contained one SNP for which there was regionally significant evidence of association (rs205990, p = 2.36 × 10−5). This marker survived interval-wide Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and was located between the genes QKI and PDE10A.	significant	male/female	rs205990		LOC105378102	AA; AG; GG	0; 0,5; 1		22773346	0.1	6q26	Edwards et al.
